     * In mathematics, the Golomb sequence, named after Solomon W. Golomb
     * (but also called Silverman's sequence), is a monotonically increasing integer sequence where an is the number of
     * times that n occurs in the sequence, starting with a1 = 1, and with the property that for n > 1 each an is the
     * smallest unique integer which makes it possible to satisfy the condition. For example, a1 = 1 says that 1 only
     * occurs once in the sequence, so a2 cannot be 1 too, but it can be, and therefore must be, 2. The first few values are
     *
     *  1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12
